My laptop mouse went crazy after resuming from standby. Running Debian 7 
wheezy, blah blah blah. Touchpad was moving my cursor randomly, nothing 
seemed to work, problem continued after reboot (which is _VERY_ 
strange...)

Workaround was

    rmmod psmouse

If trying to add module back (`modprobe psmouse`), problem is there 
again. Aargh. *UPDATE:* Couple minutes later, I tried again to restore 
`psmouse` module with modprobe, and it began working again. Yahoo! Ie.

    modprobe psmouse

`dmesg` doesn't show failures related to mouse, mouse was working fine 
before going to standby, `unattended-upgrades` package is installed, 
haven't installed any new apps lately, blah blah...

    $Â uname -a
    Linux silakka 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.51-1 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    
    $ md5sum psmouse.ko

    $ dmesg |grep psmouse
